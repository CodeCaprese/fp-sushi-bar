## View

For an easy view, I used a bootstrap table design, where all used seats are shown in green. Also a group number is
written to identify which group came together. An icon to bill the group is also included.

## Tests

To execute tests use command `php artisan test --testsuite=Feature`. **Note**: Tests are using same database
as mentioned in `.env`. 

## Which Files did I changed?

There are two commits in the git repository, the first was an initial basic Laravel commit.
The second is contains all created, modified and deleted files.

## Where is the "main logic"?

 - In `app\Http\Controllers\TableController` is the logic where the seating, check for empty spaces and check which space 
   the best option to seat customer.
 - Validation can be found in `app/Http/Requests`. 
 - The routes including the name `routes/web.php`
 - Tests are in `tests/Feature`

## Usage

First you have to specify how many seats at the table are. Afterwards you can set how many customer want
to seat down. An alert message modal will return useful information.
